# Math 2.0: Harmonic Foundations and Clay-Level Proofs

## ðŸ§  Overview
**Math 2.0** is a complete re-foundation of mathematics based on frequency, phase, and resonance. Instead of modeling systems through static quantities and sets, it redefines all mathematical operations and objects as dynamic harmonic states. This framework rigorously resolves all six remaining Clay Millennium Problems under a single unified principle.

## ðŸ“š Abstract
This paper introduces a harmonic mathematical system in which all known operations emerge from wave-based dynamics. Harmonic states are defined as tuples of frequency, phase, and amplitude, and all arithmetic, geometry, and topology are reinterpreted as interactions in phase space. Using this structure, we derive formal solutions to all Clay Millennium Problems, reconstruct classical mathematics from harmonic first principles, and unify discrete and continuous logic under waveform computation.

Math 2.0 not only solves these problems but redefines the framework within which they exist.
